# HOOD Framework

An open-source framework built on top of the Mattermost open-source collaboration platform for enabling deictic data-driven discussions via the Hyperlinked Object-Oriented Discussion (HOOD) approach.

## Use Cases

- [CS-CONNECT](https://github.com/tizianocitro/cs-aware-next-cs-connect): open-source collaboration platform built with HOOD for the Horizon Europe CS-AWARE-NEXT project, which aims to improve the cybersecurity management and collaboration capabilities of organizations and local or regional supply networks.
- [Climate Change](https://github.com/tizianocitro/climate-change): open-source collaboration platform created with HOOD to identify Information Disorder in climate change discussions.

Other implementations are available in dedicated directories within this repository.

## Papers

The main idea behind the HOOD framework is described in the following papers:

        abstract = {Individuals can leverage data referencing in collective scenarios, akin to deixis, a common human interaction in which they can physically point to relevant information. While deixis is easily performed in online synchronous interactions, e.g., mouse pointing during screen sharing in video conferences, reproducing it in asynchronous online interactions is not trivial. A significant step towards finer mimicking in-person co-presence is enhancing the granularity of links to data, enabling users to reference specific pieces of data in their content. This paper reviews 43 digital platforms in 8 sub-categories, organized in 3 main categories, and proposes requirements, opportunities, and challenges of link granularity for asynchronous online interactions.},

The reasons why Mattermost was chosen as the base platform for the HOOD framework are described in the paper [On the Road of Data-driven Discussion: a Comparison of Open-source Collaboration Platforms](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3574/paper_4.pd).
