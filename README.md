# HOOD Framework

An open-source framework built on the Mattermost collaboration platform to enable deictic, data-driven discussions via the Hyperlinked Object-Oriented Discussion (HOOD) approach.

## Use Cases

- [CS-CONNECT](https://github.com/tizianocitro/cs-aware-next-cs-connect): open-source collaboration platform built with HOOD for the Horizon Europe CS-AWARE-NEXT project, which aims to improve the cybersecurity management and collaboration capabilities of organizations and local or regional supply networks.
- [Climate Change](https://github.com/tizianocitro/climate-change): open-source collaboration platform created with HOOD to identify Information Disorder in climate change discussions.
- [Alliances](https://github.com/tizianocitro/hood-framework/tree/main/alliances): open-source collaboration platform created with HOOD to discuss European University Alliances.

Other implementations are available in dedicated directories within this repository.

## Papers

The main idea behind the HOOD framework is described in the following papers:

        abstract = {Individuals can leverage data referencing in collective scenarios, akin to deixis, a common human interaction in which they can physically point to relevant information. While deixis is easily performed in online synchronous interactions, e.g., mouse pointing during screen sharing in video conferences, reproducing it in asynchronous online interactions is not trivial. A significant step towards finer mimicking in-person co-presence is enhancing the granularity of links to data, enabling users to reference specific pieces of data in their content. This paper reviews 43 digital platforms in 8 sub-categories, organized in 3 main categories, and proposes requirements, opportunities, and challenges of link granularity for asynchronous online interactions.},
