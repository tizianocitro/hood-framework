# HOOD Framework
An open-source framework built on top of the Mattermost open-source collaboration platform for enabling deictic data-driven discussions via the Hyperlinked Object-Oriented Discussion (HOOD) approach.

## Use Cases
The CS-CONNECT collaboration platform built with HOOD for the CS-AWARE NEXT project is closed-source. Still, another use case is [Climate Change](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/anonymized-hood-climate-change-mattermost), an open-source collaboration platform created with HOOD to identify Information Disorder in climate change discussions.
